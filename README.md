## App Description
An implementation of multithreading in C by interpolating pointsi n an n x n matrix, with the use of `<pthreads.h>` in C, and in addition, implementing cpu affinity that is included in the pthreads library.

## Features
 1. It can calculate matrices that is divisible by 10 with high performance using the C language
 2. This revision has a benchmark that can test the program's performance with 3 passes on calculating matrices ranging from 100 to 20000
 3. It can calculate high numbers of matrices with the help of threading to speedup the calculation by subdividing it into smaller submatrices
 4. It can also benchmark itself automatically with predetermined n and t values.
 5. It can now assign threads to specific CPUs.

## Files included:
 - lab03.c
 - README.md
 - input.in
 - run.sh
 benchmark.sh
  
## How to setup
 - Must have GCC
 - Run `./run.sh` in your terminal.
    - This auto compiles the code.
 - Run `./benchmark.sh` if you want an automated benchmarking experience.
    - It will take in `input.in` for inputs, and output to `output.txt`
    - Modify `input.in` using the following guidelines;
        - 1st Line - `2`, for benchmark
        - 2nd Line - `8000` or any size of matrix, for benchmark
